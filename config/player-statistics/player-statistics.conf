# This changes the amount of threads used for syncing the player statistics to the database.
# A higher value will increase the speed of syncing but it could impact the server performance.
# Value should be always below or equal to the amount of available CPU cores.
# Zero or negative values will be used to calculate the amount of available CPU cores minus the value.
# (e.g. CPU with 8 cores: 0 will use the amount of available CPU cores (8), -3 will use 5 cores)
# default: 1

# This changes the interval in minutes for syncing the player statistics to the database.
# 0 or negative values will disable automatic syncing (first sync after the server has started too) - it can be done manually.
# Automatically starts syncing 1 minute after the server has started, then every interval.
#!! Do not set this value too low (if you want frequent updates, something like 10+ minutes will definitely be enough).
# (For example, Server starts at 12:00, sync-interval is 60, the first sync will be at 12:01, then 13:01, 14:01, 15:01, etc.)

# type the path to the statistics folder here.
# For example, if you have stats in "creative-world/stats/" the path will be "creative-world/stats".
